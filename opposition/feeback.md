The problem is discribed quite clearly however a better effort can be made to stay consistant, what I am reffering to is early on in the thesis its mentioned its goal: 

> *"The goal of this project was to conduct a comparative analysis of Java Virtual and Platform threads in terms of runtime performance using different thread-safe test cases."* 

- Is the problem motivated from a scientific, societal or business perspective?

- Is relevant related related work referenced to?

- Is the methodology well explained and motivated?

- Is the data clearly presented and understandable?

- Are the conclusions drawn backed up by the results?

- Are all objectives met?

- Is the report well written and have a good structure and language usage?
