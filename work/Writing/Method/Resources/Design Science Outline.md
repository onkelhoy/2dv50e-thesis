1. Initial steps
	1. **Identify Industry Needs**: Start by assessing current practices, observing the domain and business settings to understand the demands posed on the industry. This initial step is critical for ensuring that the research agenda is aligned with real-world needs.
	
	2. **Formulate the Problem with motivation**: With a clear understanding of industry needs, articulate the specific problems that your research or technology aims to address. Engage with industry practitioners, especially those in middle management, to refine this problem statement and ensure it resonates with both research objectives and industry challenges.
2. Bulk implementation
	1. **Design and implement Candidate Solutions**: Develop potential solutions or improvements that address the identified problems. This involves creating or adapting models, methods, or tools that offer practical benefits. Collaboration with industry practitioners is key to ensuring these solutions are realistic and applicable.
3. Demonstration and validation
	1. **Validate in Lab**: Before introducing the solution to the industry, conduct initial validations in a controlled environment, such as a university lab. This helps to identify any obvious flaws and assess usability and scalability without the immediate pressures of industry application.
	
	2. **Static Validation with Industry Feedback**: Present the model or solution to industry personnel to gather feedback. This step involves both giving and receiving feedback to refine the solution further. Engage with all levels of the organization, including upper management, to ensure broad support and to refine the solution based on practical input.
	
	3. **Dynamic Validation (Piloting)**: Conduct pilot projects within the industry to test the solution in a more realistic setting. These pilots should be limited in scope but aimed at assessing the solution's practicality, scalability, and effectiveness in a real-world context.
4. Communication and support
	1. **Release and Implement Solution**: Based on the feedback and results from the validation phases, finalize the solution for official release and implementation within the industry setting. This step may involve further tailoring of the solution to fit specific organizational needs.
	
	2. ~~**Model Tailoring and Consensus**: Adapt the solution to align with the specific practices, vocabulary, and processes of the collaborating organization. This customization ensures the solution is not only theoretically sound but practically applicable.~~
	
	3. ~~**Training and Support:** Develop and execute a comprehensive training program for practitioners who will be using the new solution. Provide ongoing technical support to address any issues and to facilitate smooth adoption.~~
	
	4. ~~**Measurement and Follow-up**: Establish metrics for evaluating the solution's impact and effectiveness post-implementation. Conduct both quantitative and qualitative follow-ups to gather feedback for future improvements.~~

	5. ~~**Continuous Collaboration**: Maintain a collaborative relationship between researchers and industry partners throughout the process. This ensures that the technology transfer is a dynamic, evolving process that continues to meet the changing needs of the industry.~~
