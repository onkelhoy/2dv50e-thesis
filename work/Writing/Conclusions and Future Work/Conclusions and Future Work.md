## Conclusions

This thesis presents the effectiveness of the layered architecture based framework in NDI detection using the SOCOFing and California-ND datasets. It achieves results that are similar to the alternatives or in the case of the California-ND, exceeding the benchmarks set by existing studies. This argues the promising ability of this framework and approach in terms of its high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores. The approach has been successful in terms of both matching benchmarks and improving simplicity thanks to the multi-method approach and its modular design. Furthermore, easy integration of different algorithms makes for quick adaptation allowing for robustness to the variations in different datasets. These findings of our research contributes a useful tool as well as information to the image processing community.
## Future Work
Promising results of this research open up several avenues for future studies and development:

- **Algorithm Integration:** To further increase both the potential adaptability and performance of our framework, more algorithms should be implemented inside of the Python classes.
- **Further domain testing:** Testing the framework on more diverse datasets of images would be useful in further assessing the adaptability and robustness of the framework under various situations.
- **Usability and Deployment:** End user studies targeting the ease of use of the framework could provide some insights as to how simple the system really is or isn't.
- **Use of better hardware:** Running some experiments on the framework using significantly better hardware would be very interesting to see. As of now we were limited to our laptops, but better hardware could further argue that the approach really is effective or not.
- **Ethical and Privacy Considerations:** The framework currently will require some re-work in respect to privacy. Data would need to remain safe both during storage and during processing. 

By highlighting the potential here, we hope to encourage the further development and research into this approach. The open source aspect of this project should allow any interested parties to make pull requests with changes or fork their own versions.
