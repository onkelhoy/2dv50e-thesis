1. Each group of near-duplicates is on a separate line.

1. All photos are referred to using the 3-digit index number from their filename, i.e. 003 NOT 3 or 025 NOT 25.
   
2. There is one (1) comma (',') between each number in the same group/cluster (e.g. 002,005,006) without any <space> character.

3. Long consecutive image sequences are shortened using 'dash' ('-'), e.g. 007-015,022,024-026.

4. Photo numbers in each line are in ascending order, but not necessarily consecutive, e.g. 002,005,006,007 is possible.

5. Standalone photos that are not considered near-duplicate with any other are not listed, i.e. there are no single-image groups. For example, if image 123 was considered unrelated to all other images, number '123' does not appear in the annotation file.
