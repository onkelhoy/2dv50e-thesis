- Combine with pic purge front end
- Customization stuff:
	- ~~Thorough or quick processing~~
		- ~~Thorough would mean no filtering, simply all images run through all layers.~~
		- ~~Quick would mean filtering, so images classified as duplicates are removed before the next layer.~~
	- Make different "presets" that work well for specific use cases
		- For example, this could be fingerprint processing or my moms library of images
- ~~Use chat gpt for testing against~~
- Use quote about duplicate data from Lightweight hash-based de-duplication system ...


- **Since there is no real definition of what a near duplicate image image there needs to exists a flexible way to detect near duplicates.**
- **We want to flexible and accessible/relatively lightweight**
- **False positives bad**

- Define vertical and horizontal meaning
