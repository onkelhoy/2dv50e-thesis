# Layered Architecture Leveraged For Flexible Algorithm Building For Efficient and Accurate Detection of Visually Near-Duplicate Images

Welcome to the GitHub repository for me and Henry Pap's Bachelor's Thesis on Near-Duplicate Image Detection at Linnaeus University. This repo contains all resources, code, and documentation developed during the process. The thesis focuses on designing a flexible and simple architecture to improve the accessibility and adaptability of near-duplicate image detection algorithms across varied datasets.

## Repository Structure

- **Code/**: Contains all the source code developed for the thesis.
- **Experiments/**: This holds all experiment results and analysis.
- **Research/**: All articles and general research done for the thesis.
- **Writing/**: All separate parts of the final thesis document in mark down.

## Reports and Documentation
